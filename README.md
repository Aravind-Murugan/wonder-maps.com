## WGM Services Information

###### GIS Data Analysis & Mapping

A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and decision making.

###### LiDAR Service

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method used to detect objects in real space with a high level of precision and accuracy. LiDAR technology enables the data capture on field by lighting the target using pulsed laser. As LiDAR also provides elevation data, it finds applications in several industries.

###### Photogrammetry Service

Photogrammetry uses both vertical and oblique photos for an accurate image of the terrain helping in 3D mapping of an area. Easily accessing difficult areas, mapping the terrain which even includes underwater terrains as well.

###### orthophoto Services

An orthophoto is an accurate representation of the Earth' s surface. Orthophotos have the benefits of high detail, timely coverage combined with the benefits of a map including uniform scale and true geometry.

###### BIM service

The next-generation design tool for the architecture, engineering, and construction sectors is called Building Information Modeling (BIM), and The WGM has vast experience offering collaborative BIM solutions to our international customers. has a BIM crew that is quite skilled. Building a staff with advanced BIM technical competence and familiarity with building codes, standards, and norms has been a goal of the WGM
